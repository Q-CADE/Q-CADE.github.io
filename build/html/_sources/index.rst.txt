Quantum Computation, Applications & Dynamical Entanglement
=============================================================================

Welcome to **Q-CADE**, the Laboratory for **Q**\ uantum **C**\ omputation, **A**\ pplications, & **D**\ ynamical **E**\ ntanglement. This lab operates at the frontier of the second quantum revolution, where the strange and counter-intuitive rules of quantum mechanics are being harnessed to build world-changing technologies. We use the power of quantum computation to ask fundamental questions, with the ultimate goal of designing new materials and sensors from the first principles. Our research bridges the abstract "code" of quantum information theory and the operation of practical devices. 

At the heart of our work is **Quantum Computation**, where we use quantum principles to solve problems far beyond the reach of even the most powerful supercomputers. This allows us to explore a vast range of **Applications**, from designing revolutionary materials with custom-built properties to creating ultra-efficient "quantum batteries" and next-generation solar energy technologies. We don't just study these systems; we aim to build their "digital twins"â€”perfect computational models that allow us to test, predict, and engineer their behavior before they are ever built in a real-world lab.

**Dynamical Entanglement** describes how the quantum correlations between particles evolve, spread, and rearrange themselves over time. The study of dynamical entanglement is the study of how these informational correlations form, break, and change strength as a system evolves. Controlling this dynamic web is the key to routing information in a quantum computer, allowing it to perform reliable calculations, and it's fundamental to understanding how energy and information are transported in quantum materials.

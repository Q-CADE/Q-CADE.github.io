## Double Majors and Minors
```{admonition} Note carefully!
:class: warning
Your goal is to minimize number of courses you need to take. University has much more to offer.
```



There are two important resources for you to search for equivalent
lectures. The first one is the OIBS Autoreplacement table (<https://oibs2.metu.edu.tr/View_Program_Course_Details_64/main.php>), and the
second one is the equivalency tables I try to keep updated via your
feedback.

The lectures you find in autoreplace table are always equivalent. Other
lecture equivalencies are determined by departments each semester, and
one lecture being accepted by one department does not mean it is
accepted by the other department. These work like one way connection
between nodes in Graph Theory.

For the equivalent courses, you need to choose which course you want to
follow, and fill a plea form in the department you are not taking the
course. (i.e. you want to follow the course in your original department,
then you need the fill the form in physics department, and have me sign
it)

You\'ll notice that some of the lectures you\'ve taken in the other
department, and in the Autoreplacement table are not registered to your
Physics curriculum yet. Unfortunately, this procedure takes time, around
1-2 weeks. If you don\'t see these courses after this period, you\'ll
need to fill out a plea form available at the department\'s web page,
have me sign it, and leave it at the secretariat.

If you are joining our department at your 5th semester or more, I advise
you to fill this form ASAP to have the courses ready before the
add-drops so that you won\'t have prerequisite problems.

Remember, don\'t overstrain yourself with excessive course work, don\'t
take the courses you\'ve taken the equivalent of.

Best of luck, and enjoy!

### Example pleas to Physics Dept. for Equivalent Courses

Do not forget to fill the [\"Genel Dilekçe\"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lXfGT9z5LEzipIpwuyZu_GiozwShGo-5/view) First! 

**The following pleas are for example purposes only! Please download the
current plea from from the** [**physics
webpage**](https://phys.metu.edu.tr/tr/formlar)**!**

Do not forget to remove any course you have not taken yet from the examples. These are editable PDFs.

If your department is not listed here, please try to find maximum overlap using
examples above, and let me know so that I can add it here. 

## Withdrawn courses and Graduation

In order to be able to graduate, you can not have withdrawn courses in
your curriculum. All have to be replaced by equivalent courses from your
current major. Replacements from other majors are not accepted.

## PHYS 200

PHYS 200 is a must course for PHYS students, being \"fresh 2nd year
students\" (successful from 1st year physics courses and they are on
their 3rd semester). See
[https://phys200.skyerli.org](https://phys200.skyerli.org/)

It is considered equivalent to (a course?) in CENG, however nothing from
CENG is considered equivalent to PHYS 200. Waiting for clarification.

If you think you have taken a course equivalent to PHYS 200 instructors,
they will consider their case .

*E-mail from course instructors on 25.09.24:*

> Dear advisors,\
> \
> As the instructors of PHYS 200 (Hande and Sinan), we have managed to
> pre-register students to the PHYS 200 course. \
> \
> Once again, please note that PHYS 200 is a must course for \"fresh 2nd
> year PHYS students\" (successful from 1st year physics courses and on
> their 3rd semester). We have compiled eligible students among all
> physics students including double major participants. We have also
> assigned sections (out of three available) based on the last name of
> **91 eligible students**.\
> 
>
> **Please Note:** We are a bit late to pre-register students.
> Therefore, PHYS 200 might not be registered automatically. We will be
> circulating the eligible students list tomorrow morning.\
> 
>
> \
> Since these are fresh 2nd year students, you should be able to just
> approve their registration request, which will already include
> PHYS200. In case of problems please direct the student to the
> website:\
> 
>
> -   [https://phys200.skyerli.org](https://phys200.skyerli.org/) (and
>     FAQ page there)
> -   <https://phys200.skyerli.org/faq#h.ftby1tuibiis> (for \"Weekly
>     Schedule\")
>
> \
> For special cases (double major/minor, irregular etc.), if the answer
> is not clear on the FAQ, please direct them to the query form in the
> course web site (or we can discuss it here in teams). \
> \
> We would also kindly ask you to check to make sure that fresh 2nd year
> students do not drop the course for arbitrary, nonessential reasons.
> They have already been informed about how to resolve section clashes.
> MATH 260 section conflicts are not real; students can register to any
> section and follow the course on other sections. \
> \
> In the upcoming SPRING semester (mostly for irregular or failed
> students), we will similarly pre-register eligible students and inform
> you through the list.\

## PHYS 203

PHYS203 is considered equivalent to EE201+EE213 or EE281+EE211
**together**.

## PHYS 213

-   **If you are doing double major/minor in Physics:** It is equivalent
    to PHYS202, and you can take PHYS300 if you have taken PHYS213
-   **If your major is in Physics**, and maybe doing a double
    major/minor elsewhere**:** You have to take PHYS202, there are no
    alternatives.

## MATH 219

MATH219 is considered equivalent to PHYS209 only if you are doing a
double major or minor in physics. **If your major is in physics, even if
you are doing a double major/minor. You have to take PHYS209**

## ENG 311

If you have already taken ENG211 in your major, but it does not
automatically appear in your double major program in physics, you\'ll
need to fill a petition form to Physics department asking ENG211 to be
added to your Physics curriculum **AND** ENG311 section xx. to be added
to your registered courses list. Then you need to contact your ENG311
section teacher and ask to join the section (the section teacher will
need to sign the document)


## Equivalence of Physics courses to courses in your Major program

This is rarely a thing. Most Major programs will not accept courses
taken from Double Major/Minor courses as a replacement for the courses
in their curriculum. So, try to find equivalent courses in your Major,
which can replace your double major/minor courses to optimize your
course workload.

## Replacing a replaced course

The course that will replace a course for which a passing a grade was
earned (DD or above) must be taken within the following three
consecutive semesters. When you replace the course, the term
you have taken it is considered as the first time you took the course.
So, if you took a course in 3rd semester, replaced it in 5th semester,
you **can not** replace it on 7th semester, since you are trying to
replace a course 4 semesters before, not 2!
